## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learnt a lot about semantic html and properly structured and written css.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="prep-time">
  <h3>Preparation time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Total: </strong> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li> <strong>Preparation: </strong> 5 minutes</li>
    <li> <strong>Cooking: </strong> 5 minutes</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```
```css
table td{
    border-block-end: 1px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    padding: .5rem;
}

table tr:last-child td{
    border-block-end: none;
}

tr td:nth-child(2){
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

```
